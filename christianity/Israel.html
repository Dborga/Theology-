        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to this page of my website, where I share my personal journey as someone of gentile ancestry seeking to be part of God's chosen nation, Israel. Let me clarify from the outset that when I speak of Israel, I do not refer to the modern political state bearing the "Star of David" on its flag. That star, with its pagan origins, does not represent King David nor the God of Israel. The Israel I aspire to join is the spiritual family—the descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel.</p>

        <p>I believe that humanity's collective rebellion against God at the Tower of Babel, where all shared one language under a single king, led to God scattering the people into 70 different nations, each with its own language. Among these nations, God chose one for Himself, beginning with Abraham, while the others were given over to their idols. If your bloodline does not trace back to Jacob, then you are considered a gentile. However, through acceptance of Yeshua/Jesus as your Lord and Savior, you are adopted into this royal family, becoming a spiritual descendant of Jacob. Conversely, those who are physically descended from Jacob but rebel against the Lord can be cut off from this family.</p>
        <p>In this page, I will address various questions and topics related to Holy Scripture, sharing my understanding based on my studies and reflections. I want to emphasize that I do not claim to be an expert, nor do I believe anyone can truly be an expert on the Word of God. Credentials and titles mean little to me; I believe that God reveals His truth to those He chooses, not necessarily to those with academic accolades. If you are sincerely seeking to understand the God of Israel, I encourage you to read His Word and pray to Him. If your journey has brought you here, I am honored to play a small part in it, but always remember that our true teacher is the Holy Spirit.</p>
        <p>God is worshipped in spirit and in truth, which, in my view, means that our understanding of Scripture depends more on the sincerity of our hearts than on our intellectual achievements. With this in mind, I will begin by exploring what many consider to be one of the most controversial topics in Scripture, slavery.</p>

      <h1>FAQs of Holy Scripture</h1>
      
      <div align="center">
        <h3>Morality of Scripture</h3>
        <p>The Bible begins with a brief account of creation, followed by the narrative of humanity's fall and God's plan to restore order through a chosen family. Genesis concludes with the story of this family, the Israelites, rising to prominence in Egypt. However, shortly after, the book of Exodus opens, and the entire Torah focuses on liberating this family from slavery in Egypt and guiding them to the Promised Land. The remainder of the Bible details the struggles and triumphs of this nation in relation to the Promised Land, particularly emphasizing their disobedience to God.</p>
        <p>To properly understand the Bible’s stance on difficult topics such as slavery, it’s important to approach the text from its own cultural and historical perspective, rather than through a modern moral lens. Ephesians 6:12 reminds us that our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against "principalities and spiritual wickedness in high places." Understanding these principalities has helped me comprehend many verses that people often struggle with or that some Christians may misinterpret as being excessively harsh. Many claim these verses are not meant to be taken literally and are merely exaggerations, but I disagree. Unfortunately, the most popular canonized version of Holy Scripture doesn’t provide much detail about these principalities, as they are only briefly introduced in Genesis and are mentioned sporadically throughout the Bible, including in books like Daniel 10:13, Isaiah 24:21, Colossians 2:15, and Jude 1:6. Below, I will list some verses that might make first-time readers question God's morality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Exodus 21:20-21 (NIV): “Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result, but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, since the slave is their property.”</li>
            <li>Exodus 21:26-27 (NIV): “An owner who hits a male or female slave in the eye and destroys it must let the slave go free to compensate for the eye. And an owner who knocks out the tooth of a male or female slave must let the slave go free to compensate for the tooth.”</li>
            <li>Leviticus 19:20 (NIV): “If a man sleeps with a female slave who is promised to another man but who has not been ransomed or given her freedom, there must be due punishment. Yet they are not to be put to death, because she had not been freed.”</li>
            <li>Deuteronomy 7:1-2 (NIV): “When the Lord your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess and drives out before you many nations—the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, seven nations larger and stronger than you—and when the Lord your God has delivered them over to you and you have defeated them, then you must destroy them totally. Make no treaty with them, and show them no mercy.”</li>
            <li>Deuteronomy 20:16-18 (NIV): “However, in the cities of the nations the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that breathes. Completely destroy them—the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—as the Lord your God has commanded you. Otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do in worshiping their gods, and you will sin against the Lord your God.”</li>
            <li>Joshua 6:21 (NIV): “They devoted the city to the Lord and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it—men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep, and donkeys.”</li>
            <li>Joshua 11:20 (NIV): “For it was the Lord himself who hardened their hearts to wage war against Israel, so that he might destroy them totally, exterminating them without mercy, as the Lord had commanded Moses.”</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Apocrypha, specifically the Book of Enoch, sheds more light on the origins of immorality and wickedness in the world. According to Enoch, a group of 200 angels, called The Watchers, came to observe humanity. However, when they saw human women, they lusted after them. Led by an angel named Semyaza, the Watchers collectively decided to descend to Earth to take human wives, rebelling against divine law. This union between angels and human women resulted in the birth of the Nephilim, described as giants and wicked beings. The Watchers also imparted forbidden knowledge to humanity, teaching various arts such as weapon-making, sorcery, astrology, and other secrets that were not meant for human beings. This combination of moral corruption, forbidden knowledge, and the creation of the Nephilim led to widespread sin on Earth, which, according to Enoch, contributed to the great flood in Noah's time.</p>
        <p>The Nephilim, though killed physically in a civil war as part of God's judgment, are said in the Book of Enoch to still exist spiritually today. These disembodied spirits of the Nephilim are what we call demons. I believe these are the principalities and spiritual forces of wickedness mentioned in Ephesians that we need to consider when interpreting difficult verses.</p>
        <p>Based on the account of the 12 spies in the land of Canaan, we can conclude that even after the flood, the bloodline of the Nephilim somehow survived. God didn’t entirely wipe out their race, as Numbers 13:33 indicates: "We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them." If the average person is around 6 feet tall and a grasshopper is about 1.5 inches, that gives us a height ratio of 48. If we multiply 6 feet by 48, we get 288 feet. This height difference would explain why the Israelites wanted to return to Egypt after encountering such a formidable presence, despite having witnessed many miracles from their God. Becoming familiar with these stories and the origins of evil helps us understand God's judgment more clearly before we rush to condemnation due to misunderstanding.</p>
        <p>From the very beginning, slavery has been depicted as a curse in the Bible, which is why there isn't a clear verse that outright condemns it; it is implied through various stories and contexts. After Adam’s disobedience, he was cursed with hardship. Later, we see Noah cursing Canaan, and throughout the Torah, God pronounces blessings and curses on Israel. These curses are part of the reality we now live in, and those with knowledge can manipulate these curses and direct them toward individuals or entire nations, as we see in the story of Balaam in Numbers. When God speaks, His words carry power in this world, and those who understand this can activate such functions. Curses can also be generational, lasting many years before being lifted or excused. For example, if a family carries a curse of slavery, that curse may persist through generations, whether it originates from God, witchcraft, or the sins of ancestors, as seen when the Israelites wandered the wilderness for 40 years because of their parents' unbelief.</p>
        <p>Why would God pronounce a curse of slavery? This is part of the system God established. When one enters into a covenant with God and then breaks it, the consequences are severe. However, it’s important to note that slavery isn't always presented as a curse. In the case of Joseph, his brothers sold him into slavery out of jealousy, but God ultimately elevated him to second-in-command in Egypt, reuniting him with his family.</p>
        <p>When people accuse God of being immoral, they often overlook the irony of their arguments. These same individuals praise authors of their favorite superhero movies for the complexity of their plots, which include evil characters, yet when God, the author of life, includes evil in His story, they accuse Him of wrongdoing. God is telling a story in our reality, both on an individual and global scale. When you become part of His chosen nation, Israel, you take on a significant role as part of a larger narrative. And when you accept His will individually, you live out the story He is writing for you while also serving a purpose in the stories of others.</p>
        <p>One verse often cited by critics of the Bible in relation to slavery is Exodus 21:20. To understand verses like these, it’s important to recognize that, like most passages in the Torah regarding slavery, they address hypothetical worst-case scenarios. Though it may seem hard to accept, this approach is meant to handle the situation in the best possible way if it were to occur, without escalating matters further.</p>
        <p>I personally believe that slave owners are themselves slaves to their emotions, greed, and lust, just like anyone else. The root cause of a slave owner’s violence might be greed, ego, or even alcohol. For example, if we reword Exodus 21:20 to say, “If a husband hits his wife with a rod, he must be punished if she dies as a result,” it wouldn’t imply permission for men to harm their wives. Yet, even in modern society, where we consider ourselves more enlightened than in Moses' time, reports of domestic violence are still prevalent.</p>
        <p>People often harm those they vowed to love, unable to control their violent impulses. Studies reveal common causes—alcohol, drugs, anger, jealousy, power dynamics, and obsession with careers or entertainment. As a football player and fan, I found it shocking when a 2013 study by Lancaster University revealed a significant link between domestic violence and football matches in the UK. Domestic violence incidents rose by 38% when the England national team lost and by 26% when they won or drew. The emotional investment in football, coupled with increased alcohol consumption during matches, can lead to violence. This highlights how easily emotions can lead to harmful actions, even toward loved ones. So, if people can’t control themselves with their partners, imagine how they might treat slaves.</p>
        <p>Exodus 21:20 isn’t a reflection of the immorality of Scripture, but of the immorality and emotional instability of people. The Bible acknowledges that humans are prone to being ruled by their emotions, and such laws address how to manage these situations.</p>
        <p>What’s particularly interesting is the way emotions can be manipulated. Numbers 5:14 mentions a "spirit of jealousy." This, alongside texts like The Testament of Solomon, leads me to believe that spirits can take advantage of our emotions. Feeling anger or jealousy is natural, but losing control can open the door for these spirits, leading us to actions we’ll later regret. Even after their deaths, the disembodied spirits of the Nephilim continue to influence our world when we allow it.</p>
        <p>God had a good reason for commanding the Israelites to destroy specific nations, as mentioned in Deuteronomy 20:16-18. These nations weren’t just sinful people; they were descendants of the Nephilim, beings with only evil intent in their hearts and minds. God’s command was a protective measure to preserve the purity of the original creation He called "good" in Genesis. The Nephilim’s corruption of flesh, through angelic interaction with human women and other genetic manipulations, threatened this purity. Even if there were "normal" people among these nations, their association with idols and corrupt practices would have led Israel astray, forcing God to either abandon His people or allow them to be defeated.</p>


        <h3>Is Yeshua God?</h3>
        <p>When considering the question of Yeshua's divinity, John 8:58 provides a profound and straightforward assertion where Yeshua declares, "Before Abraham was, I am." This statement directly aligns with the characteristics of God as revealed in the Old Testament, specifically referencing the divine name "I Am" (Exodus 3:14), which God used when speaking to Moses. For those familiar with the nature of God in the Old Testament, Yeshua's declaration should be sufficient to recognize that He is claiming to be the God of Israel. However, it's important to acknowledge that numerous scholars have proposed alternative interpretations of this verse, attempting to shift its meaning away from its clear and direct implications. My aim here is to share why it is evident to me that Yeshua is indeed God, beginning with an examination of the names of the first ten patriarchs in Genesis.</p>
        <p>Adam...Man</p> 
        <p>Seth...Appointed</p>
        <p>Enosh...Mortal</p>
        <p>Cainan...Sorrow</p>
        <p>Mahalalel...The Blessed God</p>
        <p>Jared...Shall come down</p>
        <p>Enoch...Teaching</p>
        <p>Methuselah...His death shall bring</p>
        <p>Lamech...The desparing</p>
        <p>Noah...Comfort or Rest</p>
        <p>Man appointed mortal, sorrow, but the Blessed God shall come down, teaching, His death shall bring the despairing comfort or rest.</p>
        <p>In the genealogical record from Adam to Noah, the meanings of their names, when taken together, form a message that foreshadows God's plan for humanity. This connection between the names of the patriarchs and the overarching narrative of Scripture is one of the clues that led me to recognize Yeshua's divinity.</p>
        <p>Another significant clue is found in Numbers 20:12. Here, God tells Moses that he will not bring Israel into the Promised Land because he disobeyed God's command to speak to the rock to bring forth water. Instead, Moses struck the rock, acting as though he was the one causing the water to flow, rather than God. This moment of disobedience was seen as Moses placing himself in the position of God, which led to his punishment. Similarly, in 1 Chronicles 21:1, we see King David numbering Israel, despite a clear command in Exodus 30:12 that Israel, as God's possession, should not be counted unless God Himself commands it. In ancient cultures, a man could only count what belonged to him, and since Israel belonged to God, David's action was viewed as placing himself in God's role, leading to his punishment as well.</p>
        <p>If such subtle claims to God's authority by Moses and David warranted immediate divine correction, consider the claims made by Yeshua, which are far more direct. For instance, Yeshua declares, "I am the Light of the World" (John 8:12), "I am" (John 8:58, 18:5-6), "I came for my sheep" (John 10:14-16; Matthew 15:24), "I am the Truth" (John 14:6), "I forgive sin" (Mark 2:5-7; Luke 7:48-50), "Come to Me" (Matthew 11:28-30), and "He who comes to Me will never thirst" (John 6:35; 4:14). These statements are significant because they not only assert Yeshua's divine identity but also show that He is fulfilling roles and responsibilities that the Old Testament attributes exclusively to God.</p>
        <p>For example, in John 8:12, Yeshua claims to be "the Light of the World," a title that reflects God's role as the source of spiritual illumination and truth. In John 8:58, He uses the divine name "I Am," echoing God's self-identification to Moses in the burning bush. This claim is so powerful that in John 18:5-6, when Yeshua speaks the words "I am he," those who came to arrest Him physically draw back and fall to the ground, overwhelmed by the divine presence.</p>
        <p>Yeshua further identifies Himself as "the Good Shepherd" in John 10:14-16, a role that the Old Testament ascribes to God as the Shepherd of Israel. He also states in Matthew 15:24 that He was "sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel," underscoring His mission to gather God's people.</p>
        <p>In John 14:6, Yeshua makes the bold declaration, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." Here, Yeshua is claiming to be the exclusive path to God, the embodiment of truth, and the giver of life—attributes that belong solely to God.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most striking is Yeshua's authority to forgive sins, as seen in Mark 2:5-7 and Luke 7:48-50. The scribes and those present recognize that only God can forgive sins, yet Yeshua does so with authority, demonstrating His divine prerogative.</p>
        <p>Yeshua also invites those who are weary and burdened to come to Him for rest (Matthew 11:28-30), promising to give them rest for their souls—a promise that echoes God's invitation to find rest in Him. Similarly, in John 6:35 and 4:14, Yeshua offers Himself as the "bread of life" and the source of "living water," satisfying the deepest spiritual needs of humanity. Moreover, Yeshua speaks of Israel as His own in Matthew 21:43 and John 1:11, affirming His authority over the people of God and the kingdom of God.</p>
        <p>Finally, additional verses such as John 10:27-28 and John 14:1-3 reinforce Yeshua's divine identity. In John 10:27-28, Yeshua claims to give eternal life to His followers, ensuring that they will never perish—a promise that only God can make. In John 14:1-3, Yeshua speaks of preparing a place for His followers in His Father's house, where He will come again and take them to Himself, highlighting His role in the eternal destiny of believers.</p>
        <p>In summary, Yeshua's claims are not mere words but are backed by actions and titles that the Old Testament reserves for God alone. When examined in light of Scripture, it becomes clear that Yeshua is indeed claiming to be the God of Israel. While others may offer alternative interpretations, for me, these passages unmistakably reveal Yeshua's divine nature.</p>


        <p>Another perspective that can help illuminate Jesus’s divinity is by examining his deeds and considering how various religions or cultures of that time would have associated those deeds with their own gods. Spiritually speaking, in every culture, followers are highly familiar with the names and characteristics of their deities. This means that even if some of these gods were to reincarnate and walk among humans, the followers would be able to identify them based on the written accounts and characteristics of those gods prior to their reincarnation. For instance, below I will provide examples of Jesus’s deeds. If his audience were pagan practitioners, these are the deities they would have likely associated him with, based solely on his deeds and their knowledge of the gods within their religious practices.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Greco-Roman Pagans</strong> The Greco-Roman pantheon was full of gods who performed miracles and interacted with the world in human-like ways. For instance, Jesus’s ability to heal the sick or raise the dead could have led people to associate him with gods like Asclepius, the god of healing, or Apollo, who was also linked to healing and prophecy. His control over natural forces, such as calming storms, might have even led some to compare him to Zeus or Poseidon.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Egyptian Religion</strong> In ancient Egypt, Jesus’s miracles might have reminded people of gods like Osiris, who was associated with resurrection and eternal life, or Horus, a savior-like figure born under extraordinary circumstances. Jesus’s raising of Lazarus from the dead could be seen as resonating with the myths surrounding Osiris, the god of the afterlife.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Mystery Religions (e.g., Mithraism)</strong> Mystery religions such as Mithraism were popular at the time. Followers of these religions often worshiped gods who experienced death and rebirth, similar to what is found in the stories of Jesus’s crucifixion and resurrection. The figure of Mithras, who was often viewed as a savior and bringer of salvation, shares some parallels with Jesus’s narrative, which might have caused these practitioners to see similarities.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Zoroastrians</strong> Although Zoroastrians might not have directly equated Jesus with one of their gods, they believed in a future savior figure known as Saoshyant, who would perform miracles and bring about resurrection. Jesus’s deeds could have been seen as aligning with their expectations for this savior, especially his power over death and his healing miracles.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Jewish Apocalyptic Sects (e.g., Essenes)</strong> While mainstream Judaism did not label Jesus as divine, certain apocalyptic sects, such as the Essenes, were awaiting a messianic figure who would perform miraculous works and usher in God’s kingdom. Jesus’s miracles might have been interpreted by these groups as signs of his messianic role, though they may have seen him as a divinely appointed deliverer rather than a god in the pagan sense.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Hellenistic Syncretism</strong> In the Hellenistic world, there was often a blending of Greek, Egyptian, and other local beliefs. People were familiar with the concept of the Theios Aner, or “divine man,” who was a human figure imbued with divine powers. Figures like Heracles and Dionysus performed miracles and were celebrated for overcoming death, much like Jesus. His miraculous works might have led some to view him as another such “divine man.”</p></li>

        </ul>
        <p>In summary, Jesus’ miraculous works, such as healing, exorcism, controlling nature, and raising the dead, would resonate with the characteristics of several gods and divine figures in these ancient religions, making it likely that various groups could have considered him divine or god-like within the context of their own beliefs.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, while I referenced pagan deities to make a point, it is crucial to emphasize that our Lord Yeshua never claimed to be any of these false idols. These examples serve to highlight the stark differences between the characteristics of these gods and the God of Israel. To properly evaluate the divinity of any deity, one must have prior knowledge of the characteristics of the god they are examining. In the case of Yeshua, He claimed to be the God of Israel, not any other figure. Unfortunately, many who reject the divinity of Jesus often have little understanding of the true characteristics of the God of Israel. When attempting to assess Jesus's divinity, their comparisons are often based on a god of their own imagination, which is not only unrealistic but often the opposite of the God of Israel in the flesh.</p>
        <p>This lack of understanding is evident in the difficulty many have with passages like John 8:58, where Jesus declares, "Before Abraham was, I am." Anyone familiar with the Old Testament recognizes the profound significance of this title, as it is exclusively associated with God Himself. No other figure in the Old Testament, including Moses and David—who came closest to sharing God’s title—dared to associate themselves with it, and God addressed this distinction clearly in their cases. Unfortunately, in today’s society, even respected scholars engage in mental gymnastics over straightforward verses like this, often for the sake of offering a "new perspective" to maintain their reputation as experts, seeking personal glory rather than truth.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, I have noticed a concerning trend among my generation, where people are falling into the trap of another pagan practice that distorts the true nature of Yeshua—this practice is known as "Christ Consciousness." This misinterpretation of Scripture seeks to blend pagan practices, dedicated to false idols, with the worship of Yeshua. Those who follow this belief often do not worship Jesus as Lord but believe that they can become like Him through meditation and enlightenment—ideas commonly found in religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism. This represents yet another departure from the truth and a further misunderstanding of the divine nature of Yeshua, the God of Israel.</p>
        <h3>God three and one?</h1>
        <p>Another question often raised about Christianity is how God can be both three and one simultaneously. While I won’t label this concept with the term "Trinity," as that has its own specific doctrine, I’ll share my personal understanding and why this view resonates with me.</p>
        <p>Many analogies attempt to explain this mystery, such as the boiled egg with three distinct parts but still one egg, or the idea of a person who has multiple roles yet remains a single individual. For me, though, it makes more sense when viewed through the lens of our own nature, as we are said to be made in God’s image and likeness.</p>
        <p>I believe that within ourselves, we reflect a similar aspect of God’s nature, though in a much simpler and less powerful way. Our body represents our physical self, which, to me, mirrors how God entered the world in a tangible form to redeem His creation. Our soul, the part of us that exists beyond this physical life, reflects the eternal essence of God the Father, who is beyond space and time and is known as "I AM." Then, there is our memory, which I see as reflecting the Holy Spirit. Just as only those who know God can experience His Spirit, only those who know us carry our memory. And even after we pass, our memory lives on to influence, inspire, and affect those who remember us, much like the way the Holy Spirit continues to move within those who know God.</p>
